Currently your Arduino can only beep like a microwave oven. Mozzi brings
your Arduino to life by allowing it to produce much more complex and interesting growls, sweeps and chorusing atmospherics. These sounds can be quickly and easily constructed from familiar synthesis units like oscillators, delays, filters and envelopes.

You can use Mozzi to generate algorithmic music for an installation or
performance, or make interactive sonifications of sensors, on a small, modular and super cheap Arduino, without the need for additional shields, message passing or external synths.

Here are some sounds of the example sketches which come with Mozzi:

## Installation
Download the most recent Mozzi from the link at the top of this page.
Then, follow the instructions from the [Arduino libraries guide](https://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries).


## Quick Start
To hear Mozzi, wire a 3.5mm audio jack with the centre to the audio out pin for your Arduino as shown in the table below, and the shield to GND on the Arduino.
Plug into your computer and listen with a sound program like [Audacity](https://audacity.sourceforge.net/).
Try some examples from the __File > Examples > Mozzi__ menu.

{% include boards-tested.markdown %}

For more about audio output, including HIFI mode, read the [Mozzi core module documentation](https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/doc/html/group__core.html#gae99eb43cb29bb03d862ae829999916c4/).


## Using Mozzi
Here's a template for an empty Mozzi sketch:

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <MozziGuts.h>   // at the top of your sketch

void setup() {
	startMozzi();
}

void updateControl(){
	// your control code
}

int updateAudio(){
	// your audio code which returns an int between -244 and 243
}

void loop() {
	audioHook();
}
{% endhighlight %}

There's a detailed example explaining the different parts [here](learn/a-simple-sketch/).


## Documentation

There's documentation in the extras/doc folder in the Mozzi download and [online](https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/doc/html/index.html).
There is practical help on the [learn](learn/) page on the Mozzi site.

## Weird things

### AVR

* While Mozzi is running, calling `delay()`, `delayMicroseconds()`, or other functions which wait or cycle through loops can cause audio glitches.
Mozzi provides `EventDelay()` for scheduling instead of `delay()`.

* `analogRead()` is replaced by `mozziAnalogRead()`, which works in the background instead of blocking the processor.  

* Mozzi interferes with `analogWrite()`.  In `STANDARD` and `STANDARD_PLUS` audio modes, Mozzi takes over Timer1 (pins 9 and 10), but you can use the Timer2 pins, 3 and 11 (your board may differ).  In `HIFI` mode, Mozzi uses Timer1 (or Timer4 on some boards), and Timer2, so pins 3 and 11 are also out.  If you need `analogWrite()`, you can do PWM output on any digital pins using the technique in *Mozzi>examples>11.Communication>Sinewave_PWM_pins_HIFI*.   

* The timers can be made available with `stopMozzi()`, which stops audio interrupts, until you call `startMozzi()`.

## Hardware specific notes

### STM32(duino)
port by Thomas Friedrichsmeier

Compiles for and runs on a STM32F103C8T6 blue pill board, with a bunch of caveats (see below), i.e. on a board _without_ a
real DAC. Should probably run on any other board supported by [STM32duino](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32).

- You will need a very recent (12/2017) checkout of the Arduino_STM32 repository, otherwise compilation will fail.
- Audio output is to pin PB8, by default (HIFI-mode: PB8 and PB9)
- If you want to use MIDI, be sure to replace "MIDI_CREATE_DEFAULT_INSTANCE()" with "MIDI_CREATE_INSTANCE(HardwareSerial, Serial1, MIDI)" (or Serial2)
- Timers 4 (PWM output), and 2 (audio rate) are used by default.
- The STM32-specific options (pins, timers) can be configured in AudioConfigSTM32.h
- Default audio resolution is currently set to 10 bits, which yields 70khZ PWM frequency on a 72MHz CPU. HIFI mode is 2*7bits at up to 560Khz (but limited to 5 times audio rate)
- HIFI_MODE did not get much testing
- STEREO_HACK not yet implemented (although that should not be too hard to do)
- AUDIO_INPUT is completely untested (but implemented in theory)
- Note that AUDIO_INPUT and mozziAnalogRead() return values in the STM32's full ADC resolution of 0-4095 rather than AVR's 0-1023.
- twi_nonblock is not ported

### Teensy 3.0/3.1/3.2/3.4/3.5/LC

Extra libraries required for use withTeensy 3.*:  
These are included in the standard Teensyduino install unless you explicitly disable them
- [Timer library](https://github.com/loglow/IntervalTimer) for Teensy 3.* by Daniel Gilbert
- [ADC library](https://github.com/pedvide/ADC) by Pedro Villanueva

Some of the differences for Teensy 3.* which will affect users include:

- On Teensy 3.0/3.1/3.2 audio output is on pin A14/DAC, in STANDARD or STANDARD_PLUS audio modes. These modes are identical on Teensy 3.0/3.1/3.2, as the output is via DAC rather than PWM.
- Output is 12 bits in STANDARD and STANDARD_PLUS modes, up from nearly 9 bits for Atmel based boards. HIFI audio, which works by summing two output pins, is not available on Teensy 3.0/3.1/3.2.
- `#include <ADC.h>` is required at the top of every Teensy 3 sketch.
- The examples come with this commented out, for Arduino compatibility.
- Serial baud rate for monitoring in the IDE needs to be set to 9600 to work with Teensy 3.0/3.1/3.2. This slow rate can cause audio glitches.
- twi_nonblock code by Marije Baalman for non-blocking I2C is not compatible with Teensy 3.0/3.1/3.2.

### ESP8266
port by Thomas Friedrichsmeier

- Since flash memory is not built into the ESP8266, but connected, externally, it is much too slow for keeping wave tables, audio samples, etc. Instead, these are kept in RAM on this platform.
- Asynchronous analog reads are not implemented. `mozziAnalogRead()` relays to `analogRead()`.
- AUDIO_INPUT is not implemented.
- twi_nonblock is not ported
- Several audio output modes exist, the default being PDM_VIA_SERIAL (configurable in AudioConfigESP.h):
  - PDM_VIA_SERIAL: Output is coded using pulse density modulation, and sent via GPIO2 (Serial1 TX).
    - This output mode uses timer1 for queuing audio sample, so that timer is not available for other uses.
    - Note that this mode has slightly lower effective analog output range than PDM_VIA_I2S, due to start/stop bits being added to the output stream.
  - PDM_VIA_I2S: Output is coded using pulse density modulation, and sent via the I2S pins. The I2S data out pin (which is also "RX") will have the output, but *all* I2S output pins (RX, GPIO2 and GPIO15) will be
  affected. Mozzi tries to set GPIO2 and GPIO15 to input mode, and *at the time of this writing*, this allows I2S output on RX even on boards such as the ESP01 (where GPIO15 is tied to Gnd). However, it seems safest to
  assume that this mode may not be useable on boards where GPIO2 or GPIO15 are not available as output pins.
  - EXTERNAL_DAC_VIA_I2S: Output is sent to an external DAC (such as a PT8211), digitally coded. This is the only mode that supports STEREO_HACK. It also need the least processing power.
    - TODO: Untested!
- There is no "HIFI_MODE" in addition to the above output options. For high quality output, either use an external DAC, or increase the PDM_RESOLUTION value.
- Note that the ESP8266 pins can output less current than the other supported CPUs. The maximum is 12mA, with a recommendation to stay below 6mA.
  - WHEN CONNECTING A HEADPHONE, DIRECTLY, USE APPROPRIATE CURRENT LIMITING RESISTORS (>= 500Ohms).
- _Any_ WiFi-activity can cause severe spikes in power consumption. This can cause audible "ticking" artifacts, long before any other symptoms.
  - If you do not require WiFi in your sketch, you should turn it off, _explicitly_, using `WiFi.mode(WIFI_OFF)`.
  - A juicy enough, well regulated power supply, and a stabilizing capacitor between VCC and Gnd can help a lot.
  - As the (PDM) output signal is digital, a single transistor can be used to amplify it to an independent voltage level.
- The audio output resolution is always 16 bits on this platform, _internally_. Thus, in updateAudio(), you should scale your output samples to a full 16 bit range. The effective number of output bits cannot easily be quantified, due to PDM coding.
- audioHook() calls `yield()` once for every audio sample generated. Thus, as long as your audio output buffer does not run empty, you should not need any additional `yield()`s inside `loop()`.
